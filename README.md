# Ganji

This gem aims to integrate Kenyan Payments solutions, something like [Active Merchant](https://github.com/activemerchant/active_merchant) to make it easier for Ruby developers to integrate local payment solutions in their applications. This gem was inspired by [mpesa_stk](https://github.com/mboya/mpesa_stk) and aims to build on what was started there, by adding more mpesa payment functionality and other payment solutions as well.
